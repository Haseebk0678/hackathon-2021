Hello person,

For this Hackathon we made a website where you can check how many doses of the
vaccine that your specefic state got. We used the CDC's API file on the amount of
doses that was recieved by pfizer per state


Our original plan was to use this data to
maybe plan out how long it will take for the entire U.S to be vaccinated but then
we realized that there would be a lot of API's that were getting called and would not
fit in the timeline
